              "'Chapter One\\n\\nVivek Ranadivé\\n\\n1.\\n\\n“IT WAS REALLY RANDOM. I MEAN, MY FATHER HAD NEVER PLAYED BASKETBALL BEFORE.”\\n\\nWhen Vivek Ranadivé decided to coach his daughter Anjali’s basketball team, he settled on two\\nprinciples. The first was that he would never raise his voice. This was National Junior Basketball—\\nthe Little League of basketball. The team was made up mostly of twelve-year-olds, and twelve-year-\\nolds, he knew from experience, did not respond well to shouting. He would conduct business on the\\nbasketball court, he decided, the same way he conducted business at his software firm. He would\\nspeak calmly and softly, and he would persuade the girls of the wisdom of his approach with appeals\\nto reason and common sense.\\n\\nThe second principle was more important. Ranadivé was puzzled by the way Americans play\\nbasketball. He is from Mumbai. He grew up with cricket and soccer. He would never forget the first\\ntime he saw a basketball game. He thought it was mindless. Team A would score and then\\nimmediately retreat to its own end of the court. Team B would pass the ball in from the sidelines and\\ndribble it into Team A’s end, where Team A was patiently waiting. Then the process would reverse\\nitself.\\n\\nA regulation basketball court is ninety-four feet long. Most of the time, a team would defend only\\nabout twenty-four feet of that, conceding the other seventy feet. Occasionally teams played a full-court\\npress—that is, they contested their opponent’s attempt to advance the ball up the court. But they did it\\nfor only a few minutes at a time. It was as if there were a kind of conspiracy in the basketball world\\nabout the way the game ought to be played, Ranadivé thought, and that conspiracy had the effect of\\nwidening the gap between good teams and weak teams. Good teams, after all, had players who were\\ntall and could dribble and shoot well; they could crisply execute their carefully prepared plays in\\ntheir opponent’s end. Why, then, did weak teams play in a way that made it easy for good teams to do\\nthe very things that they were so good at?\\n\\nRanadivé looked at his girls. Morgan and Julia were serious basketball players. But Nicky,\\n\\nAngela, Dani, Holly, Annika, and his own daughter, Anjali, had never played the game before. They\\nweren’t all that tall. They couldn’t shoot. They weren’t particularly adept at dribbling. They were not\\nthe sort who played pickup games at the playground every evening. Ranadivé lives in Menlo Park, in\\nthe heart of California’s Silicon Valley. His team was made up of, as Ranadivé put it, “little blond\\ngirls.” These were the daughters of nerds and computer programmers. They worked on science\\nprojects and read long and complicated books and dreamed about growing up to be marine biologists.\\nRanadivé knew that if they played the conventional way—if they let their opponents dribble the ball\\nup the court without opposition—they would almost certainly lose to the girls for whom basketball\\n\\n\\x0cwas a passion. Ranadivé had come to America as a seventeen-year-old with fifty dollars in his\\npocket. He was not one to accept losing easily. His second principle, then, was that his team would\\nplay a real full-court press—every game, all the time. The team ended up at the national\\nchampionships. “It was really random,” Anjali Ranadivé said. “I mean, my father had never played\\nbasketball before.”\\n\\n2.\\n\\nSuppose you were to total up all the wars over the past two hundred years that occurred between very\\nlarge and very small countries. Let’s say that one side has to be at least ten times larger in population\\nand armed might than the other. How often do you think the bigger side wins? Most of us, I think,\\nwould put that number at close to 100 percent. A tenfold difference is a lot. But the actual answer\\nmay surprise you. When the political scientist Ivan Arreguín-Toft did the calculation a few years ago,\\nwhat he came up with was 71.5 percent. Just under a third of the time, the weaker country wins.\\n\\nArreguín-Toft then asked the question slightly differently. What happens in wars between the strong\\n\\nand the weak when the weak side does as David did and refuses to fight the way the bigger side\\nwants to fight, using unconventional or guerrilla tactics? The answer: in those cases, the weaker\\nparty’s winning percentage climbs from 28.5 percent to 63.6 percent. To put that in perspective, the\\nUnited States’ population is ten times the size of Canada’s. If the two countries went to war and\\nCanada chose to fight unconventionally, history would suggest that you ought to put your money on\\nCanada.\\n\\nWe think of underdog victories as improbable events: that’s why the story of David and Goliath\\n\\nhas resonated so strongly all these years. But Arreguín-Toft’s point is that they aren’t at all.\\nUnderdogs win all the time. Why, then, are we so shocked every time a David beats a Goliath? Why\\ndo we automatically assume that someone who is smaller or poorer or less skilled is necessarily at a\\ndisadvantage?\\n\\nOne of the winning underdogs on Arreguín-Toft’s list, for example, was T. E. Lawrence (or, as he\\n\\nis better known, Lawrence of Arabia), who led the Arab revolt against the Turkish army occupying\\nArabia near the end of the First World War. The British were helping the Arabs in their uprising, and\\ntheir goal was to destroy the long railroad the Turks had built running from Damascus deep into the\\nHejaz Desert.\\n\\nIt was a daunting task. The Turks had a formidable modern army. Lawrence, by contrast,\\ncommanded an unruly band of Bedouin. They were not skilled troops. They were nomads. Sir\\nReginald Wingate, one of the British commanders in the region, called them “an untrained rabble,\\nmost of whom have never fired a rifle.” But they were tough and they were mobile. The typical\\nBedouin soldier carried no more than a rifle, a hundred rounds of ammunition, and forty-five pounds\\nof flour, which meant that he could travel as much as 110 miles a day across the desert, even in\\nsummer. They carried no more than a pint of drinking water, since they were so good at finding water\\nin the desert. “Our cards were speed and time, not hitting power,” Lawrence wrote. “Our largest\\navailable resources were the tribesmen, men quite unused to formal warfare, whose assets were\\n\\n\\x0cmovement, endurance, individual intelligence, knowledge of the country, courage.” The eighteenth-\\ncentury general Maurice de Saxe famously said that the art of war was about legs, not arms, and\\nLawrence’s troops were all legs. In one typical stretch in the spring of 1917, his men dynamited sixty\\nrails and cut a telegraph line at Buair on March 24, sabotaged a train and twenty-five rails at Abu al-\\nNaam on March 25, dynamited fifteen rails and cut a telegraph line at Istabl Antar on March 27,\\nraided a Turkish garrison and derailed a train on March 29, returned to Buair and sabotaged the\\nrailway line again on March 31, dynamited eleven rails at Hedia on April 3, raided the train line in\\nthe area of Wadi Daiji on April 4 and 5, and attacked twice on April 6.\\n\\nLawrence’s masterstroke was an assault on the port town of Aqaba. The Turks expected an attack\\nfrom British ships patrolling the waters of the Gulf of Aqaba to the west. Lawrence decided to attack\\nfrom the east instead, coming at the city from the unprotected desert, and to do that, he led his men on\\nan audacious, six-hundred-mile loop—up from the Hejaz, north into the Syrian desert, and then back\\ndown toward Aqaba. This was in summer, through some of the most inhospitable land in the Middle\\nEast, and Lawrence tacked on a side trip to the outskirts of Damascus in order to mislead the Turks\\nabout his intentions. “This year the valley seemed creeping with horned vipers and puff-adders,\\ncobras and black snakes,” Lawrence writes in Seven Pillars of Wisdom about one stage in the\\njourney:\\n\\nWe could not lightly draw water after dark, for there were snakes swimming in the pools or clustering in knots around their\\nbrinks. Twice puff-adders came twisting into the alert ring of our debating coffee-circle. Three of our men died of bites; four\\nrecovered after great fear and pain, and a swelling of the poisoned limb. Howeitat treatment was to bind up the part with\\nsnake-skin plaster, and read chapters of the Koran to the sufferer until he died.\\n\\nWhen they finally arrived at Aqaba, Lawrence’s band of several hundred warriors killed or captured\\ntwelve hundred Turks and lost only two men. The Turks simply had not thought that their opponent\\nwould be crazy enough to come at them from the desert.\\n\\nSir Reginald Wingate called Lawrence’s men an “untrained rabble.” He saw the Turks as the\\n\\noverwhelming favorites. But can you see how strange that was? Having lots of soldiers and weapons\\nand resources—as the Turks did—is an advantage. But it makes you immobile and puts you on the\\ndefensive. Meanwhile, movement, endurance, individual intelligence, knowledge of the country, and\\ncourage—which Lawrence’s men had in abundance—allowed them to do the impossible, namely,\\nattack Aqaba from the east, a strategy so audacious that the Turks never saw it coming. There is a set\\nof advantages that have to do with material resources, and there is a set that have to do with the\\nabsence of material resources—and the reason underdogs win as often as they do is that the latter is\\nsometimes every bit the equal of the former.\\n\\nFor some reason, this is a very difficult lesson for us to learn. We have, I think, a very rigid and\\nlimited definition of what an advantage is. We think of things as helpful that actually aren’t and think\\nof other things as unhelpful that in reality leave us stronger and wiser. Part One of David and Goliath\\nis an attempt to explore the consequences of that error. When we see the giant, why do we\\nautomatically assume the battle is his for the winning? And what does it take to be that person who\\ndoesn’t accept the conventional order of things as a given—like David, or Lawrence of Arabia, or,\\nfor that matter, Vivek Ranadivé and his band of nerdy Silicon Valley girls?\\n\\n\\x0c3.\\n\\nVivek Ranadivé’s basketball team played in the National Junior Basketball seventh-and-eighth-grade\\ndivision representing Redwood City. The girls practiced at Paye’s Place, a gym in nearby San\\nCarlos. Because Ranadivé had never played basketball, he recruited a couple of experts to help him.\\nThe first was Roger Craig, a former professional athlete who worked for Ranadivé’s software\\ncompany.* After Craig signed on, he recruited his daughter Rometra, who had played basketball in\\ncollege. Rometra was the kind of person you assigned to guard your opponent’s best player in order\\nto render her useless. The girls on the team loved Rometra. “She has always been like my big sister,”\\nAnjali Ranadivé said. “It was so awesome to have her along.”\\n\\nRedwood City’s strategy was built around the two deadlines that all basketball teams must meet in\\norder to advance the ball. The first is the time allotted for the inbounds pass. When one team scores, a\\nplayer from the other team takes the ball out-of-bounds and has five seconds to pass it to a teammate\\non the court. If that deadline is missed, the ball goes to the other team. Usually that’s not an issue,\\nbecause teams don’t hang around to defend against the inbounds pass. They run back to their own end.\\nRedwood City did not do that. Each girl on the team closely shadowed her counterpart. When some\\nteams play the press, the defender plays behind the offensive player she’s guarding in order to impede\\nher once she catches the ball. The Redwood City girls, by contrast, played a more aggressive, high-\\nrisk strategy. They positioned themselves in front of their opponents to prevent them from catching the\\ninbounds pass in the first place. And they didn’t have anyone guard the player throwing the ball in.\\nWhy bother? Ranadivé used that extra player as a floater who could serve as a second defender\\nagainst the other team’s best player.\\n\\n“Think about football,” Ranadivé said. “The quarterback can run with the ball. He has the whole\\nfield to throw to, and it’s still damned difficult to complete a pass.” Basketball was harder. A smaller\\ncourt. A five-second deadline. A heavier, bigger ball. As often as not, the teams Redwood City was\\nplaying against simply couldn’t make the inbounds pass within the five-second limit. Or else the\\ninbounding player, panicked by the thought that her five seconds were about to be up, would throw the\\nball away. Or her pass would be intercepted by one of the Redwood City players. Ranadivé’s girls\\nwere maniacal.\\n\\nThe second deadline in basketball requires a team to advance the ball across midcourt into its\\nopponent’s end within ten seconds, and if Redwood City’s opponents met the first deadline and were\\nable to make the inbounds pass in time, the girls would turn their attention to the second deadline.\\nThey would descend on the girl who caught the inbounds pass and “trap” her. Anjali was the\\ndesignated trapper. She’d sprint over and double-team the dribbler, stretching her long arms high and\\nwide. Maybe she’d steal the ball. Maybe the other player would throw it away in a panic—or get\\nbottled up and stalled, so that the ref would end up blowing the whistle.\\n\\n“When we first started out, no one knew how to play defense or anything,” Anjali said. “So my dad\\n\\nsaid the whole game long, ‘Your job is to guard someone and make sure they never get the ball on\\ninbounds plays.’ It’s the best feeling in the world to steal the ball from someone. We would press and\\nsteal, and do that over and over again. It made people so nervous. There were teams that were a lot\\n\\n\\x0cbetter than us, that had been playing a long time, and we would beat them.”\\n\\nThe Redwood City players would jump ahead 4–0, 6–0, 8–0, 12–0. One time they led 25–0.\\nBecause they typically got the ball underneath their opponent’s basket, they rarely had to attempt the\\nlow-percentage, long-range shots that require skill and practice. They shot layups. In one of the few\\ngames that Redwood City lost that year, only four of the team’s players showed up. They pressed\\nanyway. Why not? They lost by only 3 points.\\n\\n“What that defense did for us is that we could hide our weaknesses,” Rometra Craig said. “We\\ncould hide the fact that we didn’t have good outside shooters. We could hide the fact that we didn’t\\nhave the tallest lineup. Because as long as we played hard on defense, we were getting steals and\\ngetting easy layups. I was honest with the girls. I told them, ‘We’re not the best basketball team out\\nthere.’ But they understood their roles.” A twelve-year-old girl would go to war for Rometra. “They\\nwere awesome,” she said.\\n\\nLawrence attacked the Turks where they were weak—along the farthest, most deserted outposts of\\nthe railroad—and not where they were strong. Redwood City attacked the inbounds pass, the point in\\na game where a great team is as vulnerable as a weak one. David refused to engage Goliath in close\\nquarters, where he would surely lose. He stood well back, using the full valley as his battlefield. The\\ngirls of Redwood City used the same tactic. They defended all ninety-four feet of the basketball court.\\nThe full-court press is legs, not arms. It supplants ability with effort. It is basketball for those who,\\nlike Lawrence’s Bedouin, are “quite unused to formal warfare, whose assets [are] movement,\\nendurance, individual intelligence…courage.”\\n\\n“It’s an exhausting strategy,” Roger Craig said. He and Ranadivé were in a conference room at\\n\\nRanadivé’s software company, reminiscing about their dream season. Ranadivé was at the\\nwhiteboard, diagramming the intricacies of the Redwood City press. Craig was sitting at the table.\\n\\n“My girls had to be more fit than the others,” Ranadivé said.\\n“He used to make them run!” Craig said, nodding.\\n“We followed soccer strategy in practice,” Ranadivé said. “I would make them run and run and\\nrun. I couldn’t teach them skills in that short period of time, and so all we did was make sure they\\nwere fit and had some basic understanding of the game. That’s why attitude plays such a big role in\\nthis, because you’re going to get tired.”\\n\\nRanadivé said “tired” with a note of approval in his voice. His father was a pilot who was jailed\\n\\nby the Indian government because he wouldn’t stop challenging the safety of the country’s planes.\\nRanadivé went to MIT after he saw a documentary on the school and decided that it was perfect for\\nhim. This was in the 1970s, when going abroad for undergraduate study required the Indian\\ngovernment to authorize the release of foreign currency, and Ranadivé camped outside the office of\\nthe governor of the Reserve Bank of India until he got his money. Ranadivé is slender and fine-boned,\\nwith a languorous walk and an air of imperturbability. But none of that should be mistaken for\\nnonchalance. The Ranadivés are relentless.\\n\\nHe turned to Craig. “What was our cheer again?”\\nThe two men thought for a moment, then shouted out happily, in unison: “One, two, three, attitude!”\\nThe whole Redwood City philosophy was based on a willingness to try harder than anyone else.\\n\\n\\x0c“One time, some new girls joined the team,” Ranadivé said, “and so in the first practice I had, I\\nwas telling them, ‘Look, this is what we’re going to do,’ and I showed them. I said, ‘It’s all about\\nattitude.’ And there was this one new girl on the team, and I was worried that she wouldn’t get the\\nwhole attitude thing. Then we did the cheer and she said, ‘No, no, it’s not one, two, three, attitude.\\nIt’s one, two, three, attitude, hah!’ ”—at which point Ranadivé and Craig burst out laughing.\\n\\n4.\\n\\nIn January of 1971, the Fordham University Rams played a basketball game against the University of\\nMassachusetts Redmen. The game was in Amherst, at the legendary arena known as the Cage, where\\nthe Redmen hadn’t lost since December of 1969. Their record was 11–1. The Redmen’s star was\\nnone other than Julius Erving—Dr. J—one of the greatest athletes ever to play the game of basketball.\\nThe UMass team was very, very good. Fordham, on the other hand, was a team of scrappy kids from\\nthe Bronx and Brooklyn. Their center had torn up his knee the first week of practice and was out,\\nwhich meant that their tallest player was six foot five. Their starting forward—and forwards are\\ntypically almost as tall as centers—was Charlie Yelverton, who was only six foot two. But from the\\nopening buzzer, the Rams launched a full-court press, and they never let up. “We jumped out to a\\nthirteen-to-six lead, and it was a war the rest of the way,” Digger Phelps, the Fordham coach at the\\ntime, recalls. “These were tough city kids. We played you ninety-four feet. We knew that sooner or\\nlater we were going to make you crack.” Phelps sent in one indefatigable Irish or Italian kid from the\\nBronx after another to guard Erving, and, one by one, the indefatigable Irish and Italian kids fouled\\nout. None of them were as good as Erving. It didn’t matter. Fordham won 87–79.\\n\\nIn the world of basketball, there are countless stories like this about legendary games where David\\n\\nused the full-court press to beat Goliath. Yet the puzzle of the press is that it has never become\\npopular. What did Digger Phelps do the season after his stunning upset of UMass? He never used the\\nfull-court press the same way again. And the UMass coach, Jack Leaman, who was humbled in his\\nown gym by a bunch of street kids—did he learn from his defeat and use the press himself the next\\ntime he had a team of underdogs? He did not. Many people in the world of basketball don’t really\\nbelieve in the press because it’s not perfect: it can be beaten by a well-coached team with adept ball\\nhandlers and astute passers. Even Ranadivé readily admitted as much. All an opposing team had to do\\nto beat Redwood City was press back. The girls were not good enough to handle a taste of their own\\nmedicine. But all those objections miss the point. If Ranadivé’s girls or Fordham’s scrappy\\noverachievers had played the conventional way, they would have lost by thirty points. The press was\\nthe best chance the underdog had of beating Goliath. Logically, every team that comes in as an\\nunderdog should play that way, shouldn’t they? So why don’t they?\\n\\nArreguín-Toft found the same puzzling pattern. When an underdog fought like David, he usually\\n\\nwon. But most of the time, underdogs didn’t fight like David. Of the 202 lopsided conflicts in\\nArreguín-Toft’s database, the underdog chose to go toe-to-toe with Goliath the conventional way 152\\ntimes—and lost 119 times. In 1809, the Peruvians fought the Spanish straight up and lost; in 1816, the\\nGeorgians fought the Russians straight up and lost; in 1817, the Pindaris fought the British straight up\\n\\n\\x0c'"

(Carlos Barria/Reuters)Listen10 minShareComment on this storyCommentAdd to your saved storiesSaveSam Altman, the former chief executive of OpenAI who was dramatically ousted by its board, was at the company headquarters Sunday afternoon in active talks about returning to the pioneering artificial intelligence company, according to a person familiar with the matter, after investors complained about the board’s abrupt action.Tech is not your friend. We are. Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter.ArrowRightThe latest twist in one of Silicon Valley’s most shocking boardroom dramas comes after Altman, who has emerged as the face of the artificial intelligence revolution, was abruptly fired Friday, with the board saying it had lost confidence in his ability to lead the company.Under Altman, OpenAI built the pioneering AI chatbot ChatGPT, which has more than a billion visits.“We are working hard to get back on track,” the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private matters, said of talks related to Altman’s return.AdvertisementAltman learned that he was being fired in a Google Meet on Friday. According to a post on X by OpenAI co-founder and president Greg Brockman, who quit the company in solidarity with Altman, the news was delivered by Ilya Sutskever, the company’s chief researcher. The power struggle revolved around Altman’s push toward commercializing the company’s rapidly advancing technology versus Sutskever’s concerns about OpenAI’s commitments to safety, according to people familiar with the matter.The schism between Altman and Sutskever mirrors a larger rift in the world of advanced AI, where a race to dominate the market has been accompanied by a near-religious movement to prevent AI from advancing beyond human control. While questions still remain about what spurred the board’s decision to oust Altman, growing tensions had become impossible to ignore as Altman rushed to launch products and build the next big technology company.As rumors swirled around the reason behind Altman’s firing, OpenAI’s board has remained silent. But according to a person familiar with the board’s proceedings, who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, the real safety concern was that Altman had not been forthcoming about his aggressive fundraising strategies with autocratic regimes in the Middle East, who could use OpenAI’s artificial intelligence technology to build digital surveillance systems or enable human rights abuses.AdvertisementOpenAI declined to comment on Altman’s fundraising activities.On Saturday, OpenAI’s investors were already trying to woo Altman back. “Khosla Ventures wants [Altman] back at [OpenAI] but will back him in whatever he does next,” Vinod Khosla, one of the company’s investors, said in a post on X. Altman and Brockman could not be reached for comment.Some OpenAI employees declared their support for Altman and his potential return Saturday evening. After the just-departed CEO tweeted “i love the openai team so much,” dozens of staffers, including top executives, flooded X with retweets of his message, adding heart emojis in different colors and other messages of appreciation. Tech leaders and onlookers following the boardroom drama interpreted the simultaneous outpouring as a signal to the board and to OpenAI investors that they could face mass resignations if Altman wasn’t brought back.AdvertisementSenior OpenAI executives said they were “completely surprised” and had been speaking with the board to try to understand the decision, according to a memo sent to employees on Saturday by Chief Operating Officer Brad Lightcap that was obtained by The Washington Post.“We still share your concerns about how the process has been handled,” Lightcap said in the memo. “We can say definitively that the board’s decision was not made in response to malfeasance or anything related to our financial, business, safety, or security/privacy practices. This was a breakdown in communication between Sam and the board.”Altman’s ouster also caught rank-and-file employees within OpenAI off-guard, according to a person familiar with internal conversations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. The staff is “still processing it,” the person said.AdvertisementIn text messages that were shared with The Post, some OpenAI research scientists said Friday afternoon that they had “no idea” Altman was going to be fired, and described being “shocked” by the news. One scientist said they were learning about what happened with Altman’s ouster at the same time as the general public.Over the past year, some OpenAI employees have expressed concerns with Altman’s focus on building consumer products and driving up revenue, which some of those employees saw as being at odds with the company’s original mission to develop AI that would benefit all of humanity, said a person familiar with employees’ thinking, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Under Altman, OpenAI had been aggressively hiring product development employees and building up its consumer offerings. Its technology was being used by thousands of start-ups and larger companies to run AI features and products that are already being pitched and sold to customers.During the company’s first-ever developer conference, Altman announced an app-store-like “GPT store” and a plan to share revenue with users who created the best chatbots using OpenAI’s technology, a business model similar to how YouTube gives a cut of ad and subscription money to video creators.OpenAI unveils ambitions to compete more directly with Big TechTo the tech industry, that announcement was viewed as OpenAI wanting to become a major player on its own and not limiting itself to building AI models for other companies.Advertisement“This is not your standard start-up leadership shake-up. 10,000’s of start-ups are building on OpenAI,” Aaron Levie, CEO of cloud storage company Box, said on X.” “This instantly changes the structure of the industry.”OpenAI started as a nonprofit research lab launched in 2015 to safely build superhuman AI and keep it away from corporations and foreign adversaries. Believers in that mission bristled against the company’s transformation into a juggernaut start-up that could become the next big name in Big Tech.Share this articleShareQuora CEO Adam D’Angelo, one of OpenAI’s independent board members, told Forbes in January that there was “no outcome where this organization is one of the big five technology companies.”“My hope is that we can do a lot more good for the world than just become another corporation that gets that big,” D’Angelo said in the interview. He did not respond to requests for comment.AdvertisementTwo of the board members who voted Altman out worked for think tanks backed by Open Philanthropy, a tech billionaire-backed foundation that supports projects preventing AI from causing catastrophic risk to humanity: Helen Toner, the director of strategy and foundational research grants for the Center for Security and Emerging Technology at Georgetown University, and Tasha McCauley, whose LinkedIn profile says she began work as an adjunct senior management scientist at Rand Corp. earlier this year. Toner has previously spoken at conferences for a philanthropic movement closely tied to AI safety. McCauley is also involved in the work.Toner occupies the board seat once held by Holden Karnofsky, a former hedge fund executive and CEO of Open Philanthropy, which invested $30 million in OpenAI to gain a board seat and influence the company toward AI safety. Karnofsky, who is married to Anthropic co-founder Daniela Amodei, left the board in 2021 after Amodei and her brother Dario Amodei, who both worked at OpenAI, left to launch Anthropic, an AI start-up more focused on safety.OpenAI’s board had already lost its most powerful outside members in the past several years. Elon Musk stepped down in 2018, with OpenAI saying his departure was to remove a potential conflict of interest as Tesla developed AI technology of its own. LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, who also sits on Microsoft’s board, stepped down as an OpenAI director in March, citing a conflict of interest after starting a new AI start-up called Inflection AI that could compete with OpenAI. Shivon Zilis, an executive at Musk’s brain-interface company Neuralink and one of his closest lieutenants, also left in March.AdvertisementWith the departures of Altman and Brockman, OpenAI is being governed by four members: Toner, McCauley, D’Angelo and Sutskever, who OpenAI paid $1.9 million in 2016 for joining the company as its first research director, according to tax filings. Independent directors don’t hold equity in OpenAI.Sutskever helped create AI software at the University of Toronto called AlexNet, which classified objects in photographs with more accuracy than any previous software had achieved, laying much of the foundation for the field of computer vision and deep learning.He recently shared a radically different vision for how AI might evolve in the near term. Within five to 10 years, there could be “data centers that are much smarter than people,” Sutskever said on a recent episode of the AI podcast “No Priors.” Not just in terms of memory or knowledge, but with a deeper insight and ability to learn faster than humans.AdvertisementAt the bare minimum, Sutskever added, it’s important to work on controlling superintelligence today. “Imprinting onto them a strong desire to be nice and kind to people — because those data centers,” he said, “they will be really quite powerful.”OpenAI has a unique governing structure, which it adopted in 2019. It created a for-profit subsidiary that allowed investors a return on the money they invested into OpenAI, but capped how much they could get back, with the rest flowing back into the company’s nonprofit. The company’s structure also allows OpenAI’s nonprofit board to govern the activities of the for-profit entity, including the power to fire its chief executive.Microsoft, which has invested billions of dollars in OpenAI in exchange for special access to its technology, doesn’t have a board seat. Altman’s ouster was an unexpected and unpleasant surprise, according to a person familiar with internal discussions at the company who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. A Microsoft spokesperson declined to comment on the prospect of Altman returning to the company. On Friday, Microsoft said it was still committed to its partnership with OpenAI.As news of the circumstances around Altman’s ouster began to come out, Silicon Valley circles have turned to anger at OpenAI’s board.“What happened at OpenAI today is a board coup that we have not seen the likes of since 1985 when the then-Apple board pushed out Steve Jobs,” Ron Conway, a longtime venture capitalist who was one of the attendees at OpenAI’s developer conference, said on X. “It is shocking, it is irresponsible, and it does not do right by Sam and Greg or all the builders in OpenAI.”At OpenAI’s office in San Francisco’s Mission district on Sunday, a handful of employees arrived, declining to speak to reporters waiting outside. Altman tweeted a photo of himself frowning while wearing a visitor badge inside OpenAI’s office, writing: “first and last time i ever wear one of these,” suggesting that he intended to return.Alice Crites contributed to this report.Share CommentsLoading...TOP STORIESTechnologyBig Tech news and how to take control of your data and devicesSam Altman in talks to return to OpenAI amid rift over dangers of artificial intelligenceDisney, Comcast, Lionsgate pull ads from X over antisemitic postsThis is the growing list of companies pulling ads from XRefreshTry a different topicSign in or create a free account to save your preferenceswashingtonpost.com  © 1996-2023 The Washington Postwashingtonpost.com © 1996-2023 The Washington Post\\n\\n'"

(AP)Listen16 minShareComment on this storyCommentAdd to your saved storiesSaveRosalynn Carter, a close political and policy adviser to her husband, President Jimmy Carter, who created the modern Office of the First Lady and advocated for better treatment of the mentally ill during her years in the White House and for four decades afterward, died Nov. 19 at her home in Plains, Ga. She was 96.The Carter Center in Atlanta, which announced her death, had revealed in May that she had dementia. On Friday, two days before her death, the center said she was in hospice care at home.The Carters had been married for more than 77 years, the longest presidential marriage in U.S. history, and spent the final months of their time together at the family home in the town of Plains, in southwest Georgia. The former president decided in February to stop medical treatment for an aggressive form of melanoma skin cancer.AdvertisementDuring her husband’s 1976 presidential campaign, Mrs. Carter acquired the label “steel magnolia,” a reference to her soft-spoken Southern demeanor that disguised an ambitious and resolute nature.Determined not to be relegated to a ceremonial role, she worked in the tradition of former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt to make herself an extension of the president and his policies. She was the first first lady to maintain an office in the East Wing of the White House and only the second, after Roosevelt, to testify in Congress.Former first lady Rosalynn Carter passed away at the age of 96 on Nov. 19, 2023 in her home in Plains, Ga. (Video: The Washington Post)In May and June 1977, President Jimmy Carter dispatched his wife on a diplomatic trip to Latin America that was substantive rather than social and unprecedented for a first lady. Her grueling trip took her to seven countries and across more than 12,000 miles in 13 days. Her mission was to explain American foreign policy to a part of the world that her husband believed the United States had neglected.She engaged Central and South American government figures on issues that included human rights, beef exports, arms reduction, demilitarization, drug trafficking and nuclear energy. After each day’s talks, she filed a report with the State Department. At many of her meetings, she spoke in Spanish, having recently completed an intensive language course.Mrs. Carter championed political veteran Sen. Walter F. Mondale (D-Minn.) as her husband’s running mate and worked hard for issues that interested her personally: mental health, elder care and the Equal Rights Amendment.Despite her professional accomplishments, some women doubted the strength of her commitment to feminism. Although she never advocated repealing Roe v. Wade, the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision that effectively legalized abortion, she considered abortion objectionable on moral and religious grounds.Mrs. Carter encouraged her husband to bring Menachem Begin of Israel and Anwar Sadat of Egypt together at the presidential retreat at Camp David in Maryland for peace talks in 1978. Dividing her time between Camp David and the White House, she provided support and advice as her husband brokered a historic peace agreement between the two nations.AdvertisementIt was Rosalynn Carter, responding to plunging poll numbers for the Carter White House in 1979, who suggested to her husband that he shake up his Cabinet and give a “crisis of confidence” speech to the nation. While Jimmy Carter never used the word, it became widely known as the “malaise” speech.In her memoir, “First Lady From Plains” (1984), she described herself as “much more political than Jimmy and … more concerned about popularity and winning reelection.” She said she urged her husband “to postpone certain controversies, such as the Panama Canal treaties or some of the Mideast decisions, until his second term.” She spoke repeatedly of her thirst for victory. “I don’t like to take a chance on losing,” she wrote. “I always want to win!”In a 2018 interview with The Washington Post, Mrs. Carter said she was more upset than her husband when he lost his 1980 reelection bid to Ronald Reagan.“I hate to lose,” she said.The Carters’ close working relationship began in the farming community of Plains, where they knew each other virtually from birth. They returned to Plains after Jimmy Carter left a promising Navy career to take over the family peanut warehouse when his father died. She was a full partner in every decision her husband made in regard to the business.Years later, in the decades after Jimmy Carter’s loss to Reagan, the couple continued their partnership as co-founders of the Carter Center, an Atlanta-based nonprofit organization committed to human rights and the elimination of suffering around the world.From Plains to WashingtonEleanor Rosalynn Smith was born on Aug. 18, 1927, on her mother’s family farm outside Plains, then a village of about 600 people. When she was 13, her father, a mechanic and school bus driver, died of leukemia. Left with only a small life insurance policy and a meager pension, her mother made ends meet by taking in sewing and working part time in a grocery store before becoming the Plains postmistress.Rosalynn, the eldest daughter, looked after the younger children, helped with the sewing and earned spending money by shampooing hair in a beauty parlor. She also was valedictorian of her graduating class.She commuted to Georgia Southwestern College, a two-year college in nearby Americus, where she took secretarial courses and was active with the Young Democrats. Her best friend was Ruth Carter, the younger sister of Jimmy Carter.AdvertisementJimmy Carter, three years older than Rosalynn, took little notice of his sister’s friend until the summer of 1945, just before he was to return for his final year at the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis. After one date, the dashing young midshipman announced to his mother that Rosalynn was the girl he intended to marry.Following a whirlwind courtship, they married on July 7, 1946, a few weeks after graduation ceremonies at Annapolis. Rosalynn was a few weeks short of 19; he was 21.The young wife was eager to get out of Plains and looked forward to broader horizons in the company of her naval officer husband. For the next seven years, Mrs. Carter followed her husband to a succession of postings as Jimmy Carter advanced toward becoming a submarine commander. They also had three sons during the years 1947 to 1952.The arc of their married life suddenly changed in 1953, when Mrs. Carter’s father-in-law died of cancer, and Jimmy Carter decided to give up his Navy career and return to the family business in Plains. Rosalynn Carter hated the idea.“I argued, I cried. I even screamed at him,” she wrote in her memoir. “I loved our life in the Navy and the independence I had finally achieved. I knew it would be gone if I went home to live in the same community with my mother and Jimmy’s mother.”Inseparable: On their 75th anniversary, Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter celebrate a record-setting love story back where it all startedHer tears and screaming were unavailing. In 1954, the Carters returned to Plains. “I thought the best part of my life had ended,” she recalled in her autobiography. “But Jimmy turned to me with a smile and said cheerfully, ‘We’re home!’”They returned to Plains in time to endure one of the worst droughts in Georgia history. The peanut crop failed, the cotton and corn crops burned up, and their income that first year was less than $200.Since there was no money to hire help, they plunged side by side into their work at the warehouse — Rosalynn keeping the books, Jimmy working in the warehouse and drumming up business from area peanut farmers. The rains came in 1955, and the husband-and-wife team gradually turned the business around.AdvertisementIn 1962, Jimmy Carter ran for a seat in the Georgia state Senate, and his wife took charge of all his campaign correspondence. After he was elected, she managed the family business during the three months of the year he was away in Atlanta.She also played a major role in his first campaign for governor in 1966, a campaign that resulted in a bitter defeat in the Democratic primary to Lester Maddox, a fiery segregationist who had made his reputation by waving a pistol and brandishing an ax handle at African Americans who tried to eat at his Atlanta restaurant. A year later, the couple had their fourth child, Amy, who was born a few months after Rosalynn Carter turned 40.In addition to her husband and daughter, survivors include three sons, John W. “Jack” Carter, James E. “Chip” Carter III, and Donnel J. “Jeff” Carter; 11 grandchildren; and 14 great-grandchildren.Share this articleShareWorking behind the scenesDuring her husband’s early political campaigns, Rosalynn Carter was content to work behind the scenes. After he was elected governor in 1970, she developed a newfound confidence in her capacity as the state’s official hostess and in her public-speaking obligations.She developed an interest in mental health issues, in part because of childhood memories of a distant cousin in Plains who was in and out of a state mental institution.She served as a member of the Governor’s Commission to Improve Service for the Mentally and Emotionally Handicapped. She helped establish 134 day-care centers for the state’s mentally disabled residents, and she volunteered at the Georgia Regional Hospital in Atlanta to gain further firsthand experience with the problems of the mentally ill.“In 1971, when we went to the Governor’s Mansion, I had thought we would be going home to Plains in 1975, because the governor of Georgia could not succeed himself,” Mrs. Carter recalled. “But we weren’t. Since early 1972, Jimmy had been quietly planning to run for president.”Carter had been, in essence, measuring himself against potential presidents who happened to come through Georgia and were political guests of the Carters. They included Sens. Edmund S. Muskie (D-Maine), Henry M. “Scoop” Jackson (D-Wash.), George S. McGovern (D-S.D.) and Hubert H. Humphrey (Minn.), the Democratic Party’s nominee in 1968.AdvertisementWhen her husband made his candidacy official, she plunged in as usual in support of his political aspirations, although she recalled that when she told people during the early days of the campaign that he was running for president, she was often asked, “President of what?”She campaigned for 18 months in a total of 42 states. She recalled answering questions about mental health, education, prison reform, the reorganization of government and the price of fertilizer.Running as an outsider with a mandate to clean up Watergate-ridden Washington, the relatively unknown governor from Georgia secured the Democratic nomination and the right to contest the Republican incumbent, Gerald Ford. In the early morning of Nov. 3, 1976, Ford conceded, and Jimmy Carter was elected the 39th president of the United States.Rosalynn Carter found life in the White House exhilarating, particularly during the early months, but she continued to maintain the parameters of the working partnership she and her husband had crafted years earlier. Throughout their four years in Washington, she kept the books, wrote the checks and kept track of income tax obligations.With her husband’s support and over the objections of others, Rosalynn Carter expanded the role of the first lady. She attended Cabinet meetings, worked on mental health and other policy priorities, and formally created the Office of the First Lady in the East Wing with its own chief of staff.“There are very few people in this administration that I fear,” an unnamed White House staffer told Newsweek. “Rosalynn Carter is at the top of the list.”Mrs. Carter wrote in her memoir: “Once the press and our persistent opponents heard about my attendance at the meetings, very soon it was rumored that I was ‘telling’ Jimmy what to do! They obviously didn’t know Jimmy! But I also think there was a not very subtle implication that Cabinet meetings were no place for a wife. I was supposed to take care of the house — period.”The historic high point of the Carter administration was the signing of the Camp David Accords between Egypt and Israel in 1978. Mrs. Carter recalled that she and her husband expected to stay at Camp David for three or four days as hosts of Begin and Sadat. They stayed 12 days, pushing past dejection, disappointment and dashed hopes to an agreement that outlined a framework for a comprehensive Middle East peace.She was proud of her husband. “Begin and Sadat shared the Nobel Peace Prize that year,” she wrote in her memoir, “but it was Jimmy who had made it possible.” Jimmy Carter received a Nobel Peace Prize 24 years later for his post-presidential work on global conflict resolution and human rights advocacy.AdvertisementAs first lady, Mrs. Carter continued working on strategies for helping the mentally ill. “I wanted to take mental illnesses and emotional disorders out of the closet, to let people know it is all right to admit having a problem without the fear of being called crazy,” she wrote in her autobiography. “If only we could consider mental illnesses as straightforwardly as we do physical illnesses, those affected could seek help and be treated in an open and effective way.”Her efforts were instrumental in congressional approval and funding for the Mental Health Systems Act of September 1980, the first major reform of federal, publicly funded mental health programs in nearly two decades.“Our celebration was brief,” Mrs. Carter recalled in her book. “Within a month Ronald Reagan was elected president, and with the change of administration, many of our dreams and the bulk of the funding for our program were gone … It was a bitter loss.”The mental health disappointment came toward the end of the Carter presidency. The beginning of the end was Iran, where, on the morning of Nov. 4, 1979, militants seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held U.S. diplomats hostage for 444 days.Mrs. Carter urged her husband to immediately enact an oil embargo, but when neither that action nor any other could gain the hostages’ quick release, public opinion turned against the administration.With the president confined to the White House because of the hostage crisis, Mrs. Carter took to the campaign trail. She traveled the country as his representative during the winter and spring primary season of 1980. She also worked to woo supporters of his challenger, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass).On election night, when it was clear that Jimmy Carter would lose overwhelmingly to the Republican nominee, Reagan, a White House staff member mentioned to the president that he didn’t seem bitter. Mrs. Carter responded: “I’m bitter enough for the both of us.”“I meant it,” she wrote in her memoir. “I was bitter at what I had seen on television for weeks that I thought was so unfair to Jimmy; bitter about the hostage situation dominating the news for the last few days before the election as the media ‘celebrated’ the anniversary of the hostage capture; bitter at the opposition for deliberately misleading the American people; bitter that they blamed Jimmy for the hostage crisis when they should have praised him for his sound judgment and patience.”AdvertisementAfter Reagan’s inauguration in January 1981, the Carters went home to Plains, to the house they had built two decades earlier. Leaving the White House much sooner than they expected, they were profoundly frustrated by Jimmy Carter’s unfinished agenda and worried about the fate of the nation under Reagan.The former president was 56, the former first lady was 53, and they had to figure out what to do with the rest of their lives, as they recounted in the book they co-wrote, “Everything to Gain: Making the Most of the Rest of Your Life” (1987).In 1982, they founded the Carter Center, where Rosalynn Carter continued her involvement with mental health issues as chairwoman of the center’s Mental Health Task Force. She wrote or co-wrote five books, mainly about caregiving and mental health.She traveled around the world for the Carter Center on trips to promote human rights and peace initiatives and to monitor elections. She and her husband spent a week a year building homes for low-income people with Habitat for Humanity, and they built or remodeled more than 4,300 homes in 14 countries.In the 2018 interview with The Post, she said that in a recent remodel of their home in Plains, she and the former president knocked down a bedroom wall themselves rather than letting the contractor do it. “By that time, we had worked with Habitat so much that it was just second nature,” she said.Even well into their 90s, the Carters would walk at least a half-mile a day for exercise on the streets of the town where they both were born, and where they planned to be buried on their land beneath a pretty willow tree.AdvertisementThey conducted part of the 2018 interview while walking down West Church Street toward their home. Jimmy Carter pointed out the Plains United Methodist Church, where he first spotted his future wife. They went to a movie, and the next morning Carter told his mother that he was going to marry Rosalynn.“I didn’t know that for years,” she said with a smile, holding his hand.They were asked if they wanted for anything.“I can’t think of anything,” Carter said, turning to Rosalynn. “And you?”“No, I’m happy,” she said.Share CommentsRosalynn CarterHAND CURATEDRosalynn Carter, first lady who championed mental health, dies at 962 hours agoRosalynn Carter, first lady who championed mental health, dies at 962 hours agoRosalynn Carter dies at 96.
